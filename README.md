# SimpleNowPlaying
A lightweight application for Windows which can output your currently playing music to text, for streaming with software such as OBS.

The application reads the title of the window of your prefered media player, makes some configurable changes, and outputs it to text.

It's designed to work with VLC media player by default, but can be configured to work with other media players as long as they display what they are playing in the title of the window.

Simply run the application, and it will automatically find the running process that you specify.

Open the Settings file that generates when you start the application the first time to configure the program. Restart the program to load changes to the settings.
